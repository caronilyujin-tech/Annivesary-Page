                <p class="greeting-msg">To My Man,</p>
                <p class="body-of-content">I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to take a moment to express how much you mean to me. Your presence in my life brings joy and happiness that I cherish deeply.</p>
                <p class="body-of-content">You may feel this Cringe but let it be.You must that how much I love you. From the day we met till now We had so many memories we faced both happiness and sorrow. From day 1 you're showing a uncondtional love towards me 
                  Even though I hurted you many times ,you never left me paapuu and you always wants me . But I blocked you many times and I know that you felt bad for that . But still you never left me and you always wanted me to be with you .
                  It's totally my fault. Already I said sorry to you but know I should say sorry again . It's been four years but it's like yesterday when we met . I still remember that day .When I saw you first time . I had a crush on you . I never thought that I will fall in love with you .
                 We had so many fights,so many breakups , so many days we aren't talking to each other. It's our hard time. But I came back to you everytime I don't know why? Maybe because I love you so much. Why I thought of giving you this virtual letter to you ,I have a wish to write letter to you like in 90's. I thought of giving you this letter on our Annivesary  but I haven't completed  . So I thought of giving you this letter now . I know it's not a special day but still I want to give you this letter .  

                 </p>  
                 <p class="body-of-content">You may still feel it cringe but it's okay. The one letter can't describe how much I Love You. Our Journey gonna tells us. You're very very special to me . Whoever come and goes in your life.but I'll Be Forever. I'll always be with you.
                   Long way to go together .I'm here for you. I Love You So Much and I Miss you too. Umma üíã
